# Sojharo's Dotfiles
Dotfile configurations for my development environment (under active development)

# Usage
These configurations are done according to my taste. Please go through these and learn from documentation to
understand your own unique needs. Try to understand each line before using them. It is better to comment all
the lines out and then uncomment them one by one and see the changes to your environment. Keep those which you
find necessary for you. Don't just use the whole files as it is.

I have tried my best to not use external plugins. So, they won't break if you use the whole files as it is. 
However, in vimrc file, I am using a theme which I had downloaded from external source. You should download
that theme or just use the built-in themes which come with vim editor.
